I work as part of [Go Free Range][].

I write and blog at [interblah.net][].

Projects
--------

* **Social**
  - [Go Free Range][], the software company I co-founded to explore better ways of working.
  - [Ruby Manor][], an attempt to steer conferences away from bloat and cargo-culting.
* **Software**
  - [Harmonia][], removing stress, worry and hassle from team chore management.
  - [Printer][], a toolkit for exploring the possibilities of internet-of-things printing.
  - [Vanilla.rb][], the 'bliki' content system that runs [interblah.net][].
  - [Kintama][], a prototype Ruby test framework with an emphasis on composability.
  - [Gem This][], a very simple gem-creating tool that gets out of your way ASAP.
  - [Engines][], the original Rails Engines implementation.
  - Lots more on [GitHub][]...

Background
----------

I am from Scotland, lived and worked London for eight years, and am now living in Austin, Texas.

I've been using [Ruby][] since 2002, which is a relatively long time. I love using Ruby but I try and keep my eyes open for whatever else might come along in the future.

I am very interested in exploring the emergent behaviour of simple systems. My [PhD thesis][] explored this within the context of simulated multi-agent systems, but projects like Go Free Range and Ruby Manor can also be interpreted as explorations of the simplest systems that may yield valuable behaviour and structure.
